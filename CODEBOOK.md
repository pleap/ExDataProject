Codebook for ExDataProject
=============
The project requires the following steps:
Include a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This codebook is broken up into these 5 steps and the associated run_analysis.R  program is annoted with these 5 steps as well.

Use of the UCI dataset requires the following:
